# Willow beetle measurements

A sample of 50 willow beetles (*Phratora vulgatissima*) was collected
from a willow crop near Bristol, UK, to investigate morphological
variation within the population. For each beetle, measurements were
taken of total body length and width, among other characteristics. This
dataset enables analysis of size variation and potential relationships
between morphological traits in willow beetles from this location.

## Usage

``` r
willow
```

## Format

A data frame with 3 variables: `DBeetle`, `Length`, `Width`.

- DBeetle:

  Integer. Unique identifier for each beetle in the sample.
