# Calcium pot trial

An experiment devised to evaluate the effect of four relative
concentrations (levels) of calcium (A = 1, B = 5, C = 10, D = 20) on
root growth. Each treatment was applied to five individual plants
growing in pots. The experiment used a CRD, as shown in Table 3.2, and
measurements of total root length (cm) were made on pots 1–20 (in order)
at the end of the experiment.

## Usage

``` r
calcium
```

## Format

A data frame with 3 variables: `Pot`, `Calcium`, `Length`.
