# Demethylation experiment

This experiment is a pilot study intended to calibrate a scientific
procedure. A demethylation agent is applied to plants: the agent has the
effect of converting methylated nucleotides to non-methylated form,
causing epigenetic changes that lead to abnormal phenotypes such as
stunting and deformation (Amoah et al., 2008). The pilot study aimed to
investigate the relationship between dose and the resulting proportion
of plants with a normal phenotype. Seed was treated with the
demethylation agent at six doses, including a zero control dose. Plants
were grown in trays, each tray sown with seeds treated with the same
dose of agent and each dose was replicated in four trays: two with 60
plants, and two with 100 plants. The trays were arranged as a CRD.
