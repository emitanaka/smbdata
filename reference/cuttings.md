# Effect of type and size of cutting on willow yield

A field experiment was designed to investigate whether the type of
cutting planted affects the subsequent growth of willows. Cuttings of
five different types (A–E, factor Type) were to be planted, and growth
parameters would be measured over the following seasons, including yield
at the end of the first year. At planting time, it was realized that the
cuttings to be planted varied greatly in size, and that this might also
have an effect on subsequent growth. Two options were considered here.
Cutting size could be confounded with blocks, so that each block
contained cuttings of the one size only. Alternatively, cutting size
could be investigated as an extraneous factor, in addition to type. The
second option was taken, and cuttings were classified as small (S),
medium (M) or large (L, factor Size). Not all of the type × size
combinations were available, and the total number of plots was fixed at
25. The design was based on a five-block RCBD with respect to cutting
type, and the different sizes were allocated in as balanced a way as
possible across blocks (factor Block) and cutting types. The yield
(variate Yield) with allocation of size and type combinations to the
five blocks.
