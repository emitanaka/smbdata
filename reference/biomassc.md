# Measuring soil microbial biomass

An experiment was done to investigate the effects of changing the
procedure for processing samples to obtain measurements of carbon in
soil microbial biomass (as mg C per kg soil). The protocol under
examination used 200 g soil samples passed over a 2.5 mm sieve and
shaken for 60 min. The experiment tested the effects of a larger sieve,
two smaller sample weights and a reduced shaking time, giving a 2 × 3 ×
2 factorial structure. Each of the 12 treatment combinations was
replicated four times in a CRD. The aim of analysis is to quantify the
effects of the individual modifications, whether they interact, and to
evaluate whether any of the modified procedures obtain results within 10

## Usage

``` r

```

## Format

A data frame with 5 variables: `DSample`, `Size`, `Weight`, `Time`, `C`.
