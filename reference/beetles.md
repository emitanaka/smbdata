# Beetles

An experiment was conducted to investigate the viability of interspecies
mating in leaf beetles by examination of the results when females from
two species of willow beetle (the brassy willow beetle, Phratora
vitellinae, and the blue willow beetle, Phratora vulgatissima) were
mated with males from either their own species (intraspecies mating) or
the other species (interspecies mating), i.e. there were four treatments
in total (for further details, see Peacock et al., 2004). The experiment
was carried out as a CRD (completely randomized design) with 10
replicates of each treatment.
