# Aphids

An ecological survey was done to investigate the co-occurrence of
various insect predator and prey species. Here, we consider a subset of
the data relating to one aphid species, the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon
pisum. In each of three fields, 15 randomly chosen triplets of adjacent
bean plants were inspected and the number of pea aphids present on the
three plants was recorded.

## Usage

``` r

```

## Format

A data frame with 45 rows and 4 variables: `ID`, `Field`, `Sample`,
`AphidCount`.

- ID:
