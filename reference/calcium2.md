# Another calcium pot trial

Consider the pot trial data of Examples 3.4 and 4.1. Four relative
concentrations of calcium (A = 1, B = 5, C = 10, D = 20) were each
applied to five individual plants growing in pots arranged as a CRD. At
the end of the experiment, the total root length (cm) in each of the 20
pots was measured.

## Usage

``` r
calcium2
```

## Format

A data frame with 7 variables: `Pot`, `Calcium`, `Length`, `d1`, `d2`,
`d3`, `d4`.
