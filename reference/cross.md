# Genetics of root growth

An experiment was conducted to investigate the genetic component of root
growth in manipulated lines. Two male parents (factor Male, levels M1
and M2) were crossed with five female parents (factor Female, levels
F1–F5) and eight seeds were to be grown from each cross in a CRD. Root
growth (maximum length) was measured (mm) after three weeks (variate
Root). Unfortunately, many of the seeds were not viable because of
genetic incompatibilities, leading to reduced replication of some
treatments with only 30 observations in total.

## Usage

``` r
cross
```

## Format

A data frame with 4 variables: `Seed`, `Female`, `Male`, `Root`.
