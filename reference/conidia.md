# Conidial release experiment

An experiment was set up with the primary aim of measuring aphid
infection rates in response to differing doses of fungus. Aphids in
inoculation chambers were subjected to conidia showers from sporulating
cadavers from one of two different sources (a clone or a standard
source) for one of eight time periods ranging from 0 to 80 min.
Estimates of the conidial doses received by the aphids were obtained as
counts of spores on slides placed in the chambers. Here, we investigate
the relationship between the achieved dose (variate Conidia) and
infection time (variate Time) for the two types of source (factor
Source). Each time period and source combination was tested in each of
two experimental runs (factor Run). Separate sources were used for each
replicate of each time period.

## Usage

``` r
conidia
```

## Format

A data frame with 7 variables: `ID`, `Run`, `DUnit`, `Source`, `Time`,
`Period`, `Conidia`.
