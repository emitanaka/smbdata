# Stand density of mixed nothofagus forest plots

A survey was conducted on 41 plots of pure or mixed Nothofagus forest
located at the foot of the Andes. Each plot was classified into one of
three stand types based on the dominant tree species: Coigue (type 1, 13
plots), Rauli (type 2, 9 plots), or Roble (type 3, 19 plots). For each
plot, stand density (number of trees per hectare, SD) and mean quadratic
diameter (in cm, QD) were recorded. The primary aim of the study was to
model how stand density relates to quadratic diameter and to compare
this relationship across the three forest stand types.

## Usage

``` r
forest
```

## Format

A data frame with 4 variables: `DPlot`, `Type`, `SD`, `QD`.

- DPlot:

  Integer. Unique identifier for each forest plot.

- Type:

  Character. Forest stand type classified by dominant Nothofagus species
  in the plot: "Coigue", "Rauli", or "Roble".

- SD:

  Integer. Stand density, recorded as the number of trees per hectare in
  each plot.

- QD:

  Numeric. Mean quadratic diameter (in centimeters) of trees in the
  plot.
