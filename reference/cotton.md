# Cotton response to herbicide and insecticide

An experiment was done to evaluate the combined effects of five
different doses of herbicide (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 lb/acre) and five
different doses of insecticide (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 lb/acre) on
the root growth of cotton plants in containers within a glasshouse. Four
replicates of each treatment combination were arranged in a CRD. After
three weeks, the dry root biomass (g/plant) was measured for each
container.
