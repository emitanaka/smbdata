# ELISA calibration

A calibration experiment was done to establish a suitable protocol for
an experimental procedure. Three methods of preparation (factor Prep)
were tested in combination with four different initial concentrations
(factor Conc), with two replicates of each combination. The solutions
were applied in randomized order to an ELISA plate and processed.

## Usage

``` r
calibrate
```

## Format

A data frame with 4 variables: `Unit`, `Prep`, `Conc`, `Absorbance`.
