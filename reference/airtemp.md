# Air temperature

Air temperature measurements (°C) recorded at approximately 9 a.m. on
100 days during 2006 using two instruments: a standard glass mercury
dry-bulb thermometer and a new electronic dry-bulb thermistor probe. For
each day, the dataset includes the day number and paired temperature
readings from both devices, enabling direct comparison between the
established and new measurement methods.
