\description{
An experiment was set up with the primary aim of measuring aphid infection rates in response to differing doses of fungus. Aphids in inoculation chambers were subjected to conidia showers from sporulating cadavers from one of two different sources (a clone or a standard source) for one of eight time periods ranging from 0 to 80 min. Estimates of the conidial doses received by the aphids were obtained as counts of spores on slides placed in the chambers. Here, we investigate the relationship between the achieved dose (variate Conidia) and infection time (variate Time) for the two types of source (factor Source). Each time period and source combination was tested in each of two experimental runs (factor Run). Separate sources were used for each replicate of each time period.
