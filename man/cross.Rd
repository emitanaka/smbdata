\description{
An experiment was conducted to investigate the genetic component of root growth in manipulated lines. Two male parents (factor Male, levels M1 and M2) were crossed with five female parents (factor Female, levels F1â€“F5) and eight seeds were to be grown from each cross in a CRD. Root growth (maximum length) was measured (mm) after three weeks (variate Root). Unfortunately, many of the seeds were not viable because of genetic incompatibilities, leading to reduced replication of some treatments with only 30 observations in total.
