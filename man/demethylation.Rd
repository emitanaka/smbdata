\description{
This pilot study aimed to calibrate a scientific protocol by assessing the effect of a demethylation agent on plant phenotype. Seeds were treated with six different doses of the agent, including a zero-dose control, and then sown in trays, with each tray containing seeds treated at the same dose. Each dose was replicated across four trays: two containing 60 plants and two containing 100 plants. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design. For each tray, the number of plants exhibiting a normal phenotype (Normal) and the total number of plants (Total) were recorded, with each tray identified by a unique index (DTray). The dataset allows investigation of the relationship between agent dose and the binomially distributed probability of plants showing a normal phenotype.
