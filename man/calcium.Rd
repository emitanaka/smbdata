\description{
An experiment devised to evaluate the effect of four relative concentrations (levels) of calcium (A = 1, B = 5, C = 10, D = 20) on root growth. Each treatment was applied to five individual plants growing in pots. The experiment used a CRD, as shown in Table 3.2, and measurements of total root length (cm) were made on pots 1â€“20 (in order) at the end of the experiment.
