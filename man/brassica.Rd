\description{
An experiment was done to screen a set of fungal isolates for pathogenicity on seedlings of oilseed rape. The isolates were collected from two different species of Brassica, labelled as A and B in factor Species, with several different isolates from each species being tested (nine in group A and four in group B), labelled by factor Isolate (with nine levels). The experiment was run in three replicates across time (factor Rep), with a tray of 22 (replicate 2) or 23 seedlings (replicates 1 and 3) being tested against each isolate in each run (factor Tray, with 13 levels). The number of seedlings tested was stored in variate Seedlings. The number of resistant seedlings, i.e. those showing no signs of infection (variate Resistant), was recorded five days after the isolates were applied.
