\description{
A glasshouse experiment was conducted to examine how different doses of a growth regulator affect plant height under controlled conditions. Six increasing doses (Dose) were each applied to four replicate plants, with each plant grown in a separate pot. The pots were arranged in a completely randomized design on a bench grid comprising four rows (Row) and six columns (Column). After six weeks, the height of each plant (in cm; Height) was measured. This setup enables analysis of the effect of growth regulator dose on plant height, while accounting for any potential spatial variation across the grid layout.
