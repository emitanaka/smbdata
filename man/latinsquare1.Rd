\description{
An experiment was designed to study the effect of petal colour on the influx of pollen beetles into oilseed rape crops. Five distinct shades of petal colour were tested using a Latin Square (LS) design to control for migration direction within the field. Due to high spatial variability in beetle counts observed in previous research, the LS experiment was replicated in two independent adjacent fields to improve the precision of treatment comparisons. The two squares had the same orientation, but row and column effects were considered independent between replicates, ensuring that comparisons reflected only the treatment and spatial trends within each field.
