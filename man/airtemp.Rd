\description{
Air temperature measurements (°C) recorded at approximately 9 a.m. on 100 days during 2006 using two instruments: a standard glass mercury dry-bulb thermometer and a new electronic dry-bulb thermistor probe. For each day, the dataset includes the day number and paired temperature readings from both devices, enabling direct comparison between the established and new measurement methods.
